# Saaze

Saaze is an all-inclusive, flat-file CMS for simple websites and blogs. It's not designed to be a replacement for great CMS's (e.g. WordPress, Statamic etc.), rather it's designed to be a smaller, simpler alternative.

Why is there a need for a simpler alternative? WordPress is a great CMS but it can become bloated and a maintenance nightmare for a simple sites. Static site builders are fast but normally have a steep learning curve and require lots of tooling to make them work. We believe building a personal site should be stupidly simple. That's why Saaze is built on the following principles.

* Easy to run - All you need is PHP and Composer
* Easy to host - Serve dynamically or statically
* Easy to edit - Edit content using simple Markdown files
* Easy to theme - Templates use Blade (and optionally PHP)
* Fast and secure - No database = less moving parts + more speed
* Simple to understand - Everything is a collection of entries
* All-inclusive - CLI for easily serving and building your site
